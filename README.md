# Build a Music Event Web Scraper Using Python

## Description

This project demonstrates how to build a web scraper that collects information about upcoming music events from a specified website. The scraped data is stored in an SQLite database, and email notifications are sent whenever new events are detected.

## Process

1. **Scrape Website**: Fetch the HTML source from a specified URL.
2. **Extract Data**: Use a CSS selector to extract specific information about upcoming music events from the HTML source.
3. **Store Data**: Save the extracted data in an SQLite database.
4. **Send Email Notification**: Send an email notification when a new event is detected.
5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Check the database to ensure that only new events trigger an email notification.

## Technology Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for the application.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch the webpage content.
- **Selectorlib**: For extracting specific information from the webpage using CSS selectors.
- **SQLite**: For storing the scraped data.
- **smtplib**: For sending email notifications.
- **SSL**: For securing the email connection.
- **Pycharm IDE**: Used for developing and debugging the project.
- **DB Browser for SQLite**: Used for managing the SQLite database.

## What I Learned from This Project

- **Web Scraping**: How to scrape data from websites using requests and selectorlib.
- **Data Extraction**: Using CSS selectors to extract specific information from HTML content.
- **Database Management**: How to store and query data using SQLite.
- **Email Automation**: Sending automated email notifications using smtplib and SSL.
- **Error Handling**: Managing potential errors and ensuring the application runs smoothly.
- **Project Organization**: Structuring a Python project with multiple modules and handling dependencies.

## How can I use this in my Future Projects

- **Web Scraping**: The techniques used here can be applied to scrape different types of data from various websites.
- **Database Integration**: The integration of SQLite can be extended to other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Email Notifications**: The email notification system can be adapted to notify users about different types of events or updates.
- **Automation**: The automation logic can be reused to build other automated data collection and notification systems.
